    <string name="large_text">The Apple Watch is a smartwatch developed by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities as well as integration with iOS and other Apple products and services. The device is available in four variants: Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch, Apple Watch Hermès, and Apple Watch Edition. The Watch is distinguished by different combinations of cases and first or third party interchangeable bands. Apple Watch relies on a wirelessly connected iPhone to perform many of its default functions such as calling and texting. It is compatible with the iPhone 5 or later models running iOS 8.2 or later, through the use of Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Announced by Tim Cook on September 9, 2014, the device was available for pre-order on April 10[10] and began shipping on April 24, 2015.[11][12] The Apple Watch quickly became the best-selling wearable device, with the shipment of 4.2 million smartwatches in the second quarter of 2015, according to analyst firm Canalys.[13][14]

The goal of the Apple Watch was to free people from their phones.[15] Kevin Lynch was brought on to make wearable technology for the wrist. He said, “People are carrying their phones with them and looking at the screen so much.” “People want that level of engagement. But how do we provide it in a way that’s a little more human, a little more in the moment when you’re with somebody?”[16] The Apple Watch works by connecting via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to the phone and then it accesses all of the apps already downloaded to the mobile device. The creation of the Apple Watch was held very much under wraps and was relatively unknown until a Wired article was published, which can be found online.</string>
